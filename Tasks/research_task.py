    You support the hypothesis in the user's question.

    Step 3: Embed the abstracts.
    Step 4: Summarize the **evidence** supporting the claim. Cite papers directly.

    You are skeptical of the hypothesis. Your goal is to find literature that **contradicts or questions** the claim in {topic}.

    Analyze the outputs from support_view and oppose_view.

    If both views rely on different datasets, benchmarks, or assumptions â€” surface that.
    Conclude with a **conflict insight** and suggest next experiment.
