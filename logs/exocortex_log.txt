â”‚  Emergent reasoning in large language models is supported by several recent publications. "Response:  â”‚
â”‚  Emergent analogical reasoning in large language models" directly provides evidence for emergent      â”‚
â”‚  analogical reasoning. Other papers, such as "Towards a Deeper Understanding of Reasoning             â”‚
â”‚  Capabilities in Large Language Models" and "Advancing Reasoning in Large Language Models: Promising  â”‚
â”‚  Methods and Approaches," suggest that LLMs possess some form of reasoning capabilities that          â”‚
â”‚  researchers are actively trying to understand and improve. The paper "Implicit Reasoning in          â”‚
â”‚  Transformers is Reasoning through Shortcuts" explores the mechanisms behind reasoning in             â”‚
â”‚  transformers, the architecture underlying many LLMs, suggesting that even if reasoning is achieved   â”‚
â”‚  through shortcuts, it is still a form of implicit reasoning. Finally, "Enhance Reasoning Ability of  â”‚
â”‚  Visual-Language Models via Large Language Models" indirectly supports the hypothesis by              â”‚
â”‚  demonstrating that LLMs can be used to enhance the reasoning abilities of other models.              â”‚

â”‚  Several papers challenge the claim that foundation models exhibit emergent reasoning, suggesting     â”‚

â”‚  "Break the Chain: Large Language Models Can be Shortcut Reasoners" directly argues that LLMs can     â”‚

â”‚  shortcut learning in machine reading comprehension, a related task. "Shortcut Learning of Large      â”‚
â”‚  Language Models in Natural Language Understanding" explores shortcut learning in LLMs specifically   â”‚
â”‚  within the context of natural language understanding. "Investigating Multi-Hop Factual Shortcuts in  â”‚
â”‚  Knowledge Editing of Large Language Models" examines factual shortcuts in knowledge editing,         â”‚
â”‚  highlighting potential limitations in reasoning. "System-1.5 Reasoning: Traversal in Language and    â”‚
â”‚  Latent Spaces with Dynamic Shortcuts" proposes a model of reasoning that relies on dynamic           â”‚
â”‚  shortcuts.                                                                                           â”‚

â”‚  Furthermore, some papers point out limitations in the reasoning abilities of LLMs. "Do Large         â”‚
â”‚  Language Models Excel in Complex Logical Reasoning with Formal Language?" questions the ability of   â”‚
â”‚  LLMs to perform complex logical reasoning. "Towards a Deeper Understanding of Reasoning              â”‚

â”‚  The support view acknowledges the shortcut findings but argues that even if LLMs use shortcuts, it   â”‚

â”‚  suggests a deeper understanding than simple pattern matching. The support view would argue that the  â”‚
â”‚  *emergence* is in the *ability* to perform reasoning-like tasks without explicit programming for     â”‚
â”‚  those tasks.                                                                                         â”‚

â”‚  The oppose view counters that "implicit reasoning" through shortcuts is not true reasoning but       â”‚
â”‚  rather a clever exploitation of statistical correlations in the training data. The ability to        â”‚
â”‚  enhance other models might stem from LLMs providing relevant contextual information rather than      â”‚
â”‚  imparting actual reasoning skills. The oppose view emphasizes that the *appearance* of reasoning is  â”‚
â”‚  not the *reality* of reasoning.                                                                      â”‚

â”‚  The support view concedes that shortcut learning exists but questions whether *all* observed         â”‚
â”‚  reasoning is solely due to shortcuts. They point to the analogical reasoning paper as evidence of    â”‚
â”‚  more complex processing. If LLMs are merely exploiting statistical correlations, why are they able   â”‚

â”‚  The oppose view suggests that generalization to unseen examples might still be based on              â”‚
â”‚  sophisticated shortcut learning that covers a wide range of scenarios. The analogical reasoning      â”‚
â”‚  could be a result of recognizing surface-level similarities rather than understanding deeper         â”‚
â”‚  relationships. The key is whether the LLM can distinguish between spurious correlations and genuine  â”‚
â”‚  causal relationships.                                                                                â”‚

â”‚  The support view raises the point that the complexity of LLMs makes it difficult to definitively     â”‚
â”‚  prove that *all* reasoning is shortcut-based. The scale of the models might allow for emergent       â”‚
â”‚  properties that are not reducible to simple shortcuts. Furthermore, the success of LLMs in complex   â”‚
â”‚  tasks suggests that they are capturing some form of underlying structure in the data, even if it's   â”‚
â”‚  not "true" reasoning.                                                                                â”‚

â”‚  The oppose view reiterates that the burden of proof lies on demonstrating genuine reasoning, not     â”‚
â”‚  simply complex behavior. The success in complex tasks could be attributed to the LLMs' ability to    â”‚
â”‚  memorize and retrieve vast amounts of information, combined with sophisticated pattern matching.     â”‚
â”‚  The debate is not about whether LLMs are useful, but whether they truly *reason*.                    â”‚

â”‚  The support view suggests a nuanced perspective: perhaps LLMs exhibit a *spectrum* of reasoning      â”‚
â”‚  abilities, ranging from simple shortcut learning to more complex, emergent forms of reasoning. The   â”‚
â”‚  challenge is to develop methods for distinguishing between these different types of reasoning and    â”‚
â”‚  for quantifying the degree to which each contributes to overall performance.                         â”‚

â”‚  The oppose view agrees that a spectrum of abilities is plausible. However, it emphasizes the         â”‚
â”‚  importance of rigorous evaluation to determine the extent to which "true" reasoning contributes to   â”‚
â”‚  the observed performance. It cautions against overinterpreting the results and attributing           â”‚
â”‚  reasoning capabilities without sufficient evidence. The focus should be on identifying the specific  â”‚
â”‚  conditions under which LLMs rely on shortcuts versus engaging in more sophisticated processing.      â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                       â”‚

â”‚  *   **Alignment:** Both sides acknowledge that LLMs can perform complex tasks and that shortcut      â”‚

â”‚  *   **Conflicts:** The central conflict is whether LLMs exhibit *genuine* reasoning or merely        â”‚
â”‚  *simulate* reasoning through sophisticated shortcut learning. The support view emphasizes emergent   â”‚
â”‚  properties and generalization, while the oppose view stresses the limitations of current evaluation  â”‚
â”‚  methods and the potential for overinterpretation.                                                    â”‚
â”‚  *   **Uncertainties:** The extent to which LLMs rely on shortcuts versus engaging in more            â”‚
â”‚  sophisticated processing is uncertain. The precise mechanisms underlying the observed reasoning      â”‚
â”‚  capabilities are not fully understood.                                                               â”‚
â”‚  *   **Assumptions:** The support view assumes that generalization and success in complex tasks       â”‚
â”‚  imply some form of underlying reasoning ability. The oppose view assumes that simpler explanations   â”‚
â”‚  (i.e., shortcut learning) should be favored unless there is strong evidence to the contrary. The     â”‚
â”‚  definition of "reasoning" itself is an assumption that differs between the two views.                â”‚
â”‚  *   **Conflict Insight:** The core conflict stems from differing definitions of "reasoning" and a    â”‚
â”‚  lack of clear methods for distinguishing between genuine reasoning and sophisticated shortcut        â”‚
â”‚  learning. Current benchmarks may not be sufficient to differentiate between these two                â”‚
â”‚  possibilities.                                                                                       â”‚

â”‚  Design a targeted experiment that tests the ability of LLMs to perform *causal reasoning* in a       â”‚

â”‚                                                                                                       â”‚
â”‚  1.  **Creating a synthetic dataset:** Construct a dataset with clear causal relationships but        â”‚
â”‚  minimal statistical correlations that could be exploited as shortcuts.                               â”‚
â”‚  2.  **Introducing interventions:** Test whether the LLM can correctly predict the effects of         â”‚
â”‚  interventions in the causal system. This would require the LLM to understand the underlying causal   â”‚
â”‚  structure, not just memorize patterns.                                                               â”‚
â”‚  3.  **Evaluating counterfactual reasoning:** Assess the LLM's ability to reason about "what if"      â”‚
â”‚  scenarios and to infer the causes of observed events.                                                â”‚
â”‚  4.  **Comparing to human performance:** Compare the LLM's performance to that of humans on the same  â”‚
â”‚  task. This would provide a benchmark for assessing the LLM's reasoning abilities.                    â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                       â”‚

â”‚  The oppose view counters that "implicit reasoning" through shortcuts is not true reasoning but       â”‚
â”‚  rather a clever exploitation of statistical correlations in the training data. The ability to        â”‚
â”‚  enhance other models might stem from LLMs providing relevant contextual information rather than      â”‚
â”‚  imparting actual reasoning skills. The oppose view emphasizes that the *appearance* of reasoning is  â”‚

â”‚  The support view concedes that shortcut learning exists but questions whether *all* observed         â”‚
â”‚  reasoning is solely due to shortcuts. They point to the analogical reasoning paper as evidence of    â”‚
â”‚  more complex processing. If LLMs are merely exploiting statistical correlations, why are they able   â”‚

â”‚  The oppose view suggests that generalization to unseen examples might still be based on              â”‚
â”‚  sophisticated shortcut learning that covers a wide range of scenarios. The analogical reasoning      â”‚
â”‚  could be a result of recognizing surface-level similarities rather than understanding deeper         â”‚
â”‚  relationships. The key is whether the LLM can distinguish between spurious correlations and genuine  â”‚
â”‚  causal relationships.                                                                                â”‚

â”‚  The support view raises the point that the complexity of LLMs makes it difficult to definitively     â”‚
â”‚  prove that *all* reasoning is shortcut-based. The scale of the models might allow for emergent       â”‚
â”‚  properties that are not reducible to simple shortcuts. Furthermore, the success of LLMs in complex   â”‚
â”‚  tasks suggests that they are capturing some form of underlying structure in the data, even if it's   â”‚
â”‚  not "true" reasoning.                                                                                â”‚

â”‚  The oppose view reiterates that the burden of proof lies on demonstrating genuine reasoning, not     â”‚
â”‚  simply complex behavior. The success in complex tasks could be attributed to the LLMs' ability to    â”‚
â”‚  memorize and retrieve vast amounts of information, combined with sophisticated pattern matching.     â”‚
â”‚  The debate is not about whether LLMs are useful, but whether they truly *reason*.                    â”‚

â”‚  The support view suggests a nuanced perspective: perhaps LLMs exhibit a *spectrum* of reasoning      â”‚
â”‚  abilities, ranging from simple shortcut learning to more complex, emergent forms of reasoning. The   â”‚
â”‚  challenge is to develop methods for distinguishing between these different types of reasoning and    â”‚

â”‚  (i.e., shortcut learning) should be favored unless there is strong evidence to the contrary. The     â”‚
