LoRA may not always be the best fine-tuning method for LLaMA 2 due to limitations highlighted in recent research. Specifically, "CURLoRA: Stable LLM Continual Fine-Tuning and Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation" identifies the problem of catastrophic forgetting in LoRA when applied to continual learning scenarios. This suggests that LoRA struggles to adapt to new information without losing previously learned knowledge. Furthermore, "BA-LoRA: Bias-Alleviating Low-Rank Adaptation to Mitigate Catastrophic Inheritance in Large Language Models" points out that LoRA can amplify biases present in the training data, leading to undesirable outcomes. Finally, the paper "LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?" raises concerns about the optimization process of LoRA, implying that it may not always achieve optimal performance. These findings suggest that alternative fine-tuning methods might be more suitable in scenarios where catastrophic forgetting, bias amplification, or optimization issues are critical concerns.
