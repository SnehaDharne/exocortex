Evidence suggests that LoRA remains a viable fine-tuning method. A comparative study on Chinese instruction data found LoRA to be effective for instruction following in large language models ("A Comparative Study between Full-Parameter and LoRA-based Fine-Tuning on Chinese Instruction Data for Instruction Following Large Language Model"). Furthermore, a case study on multilingual news article classification compared parameter-efficient techniques, including LoRA, with full fine-tuning, providing further evidence for LoRA's utility ("Comparison between parameter-efficient techniques and full fine-tuning: A case study on multilingual news article classification"). These studies, conducted before July 16, 2025, support the continued relevance of LoRA as a fine-tuning approach.
