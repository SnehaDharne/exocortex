While transformer-based architectures, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have demonstrated impressive performance on large-scale vision tasks, the claim of their universal superiority over Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) warrants critical examination. A significant counter-argument lies in the **data efficiency** of these models.

Vision Transformers are often "data-hungry" and typically require vast amounts of training data to outperform CNNs. In scenarios with smaller datasets, CNNs can still be competitive or even superior due to their inherent inductive biases (e.g., locality and translation equivariance), which are well-suited for image data and require less explicit learning from massive datasets.

Evidence supporting this limitation includes:
*   The observation that "Masked autoencoders are effective solution to transformer data-hungry" suggests that techniques like masked autoencoding are necessary to mitigate the high data requirements of transformers, implying that without such strategies, their performance on limited data might be suboptimal compared to CNNs.
*   Research into "Convolutional Initialization for Data-Efficient Vision Transformers" indicates that incorporating convolutional inductive biases into ViTs, particularly through initialization, is a strategy to make them more data-efficient. This highlights that pure transformer architectures may lack the inherent efficiency of CNNs in data-constrained environments and benefit from CNN-like features.
*   The development of models like "BinaryViT: Pushing Binary Vision Transformers Towards Convolutional Models" further illustrates a trend where transformer architectures are being modified or "pushed towards" convolutional models, often to gain efficiencies or performance characteristics traditionally associated with CNNs, such as reduced computational cost and improved data handling.

In conclusion, while ViTs excel with abundant data, CNNs maintain a strong competitive edge, especially on smaller datasets or when computational and data efficiency are critical considerations. The ongoing research into integrating convolutional inductive biases into transformer architectures further suggests that the perceived "superiority" of ViTs is not absolute and often depends on specific conditions and architectural modifications that borrow from CNN principles.
